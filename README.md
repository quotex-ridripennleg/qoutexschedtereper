## Is Quotex Legal in India in 2024?

While binary options trading is legal in certain jurisdictions, India
has stringent regulations that govern foreign trading platforms. In
2024, Quotex exists in a gray area. Although it operates under a license
from an offshore regulator, it isn\'t registered with SEBI. This raises
questions about its legal standing for Indian users. The lack of direct
oversight means that those engaging with Quotex may not benefit from the
same protections as those trading on SEBI-regulated platforms.
